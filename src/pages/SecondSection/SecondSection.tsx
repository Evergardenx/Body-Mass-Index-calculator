        <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
        <p>
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
          Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
          experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type
          2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and
          sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
          Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about
          30 minutes daily for five days a week.
